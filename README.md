# ImageProcessingWebSite
A web-based image processing app built with Flask. Users can upload images, apply filters (mean, median, edge detection), view histograms, and download results. Processing uses OpenCV, with some filters manually implemented.

This project is a web image processing application developed using the Python-based Flask framework. Users can upload an image, apply filters (mean, median, edge detection, etc.), view histogram analysis and download processed images through the web interface. Basic image processing functions will be done with OpenCV and some filtering operations will be coded so that they can be applied directly manually.
